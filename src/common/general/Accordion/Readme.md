### Accordion
```js
<Accordion title="AccordionTitle">
    <p>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.</p>

    <p>We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Now then, let's play. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Put it in, leave it alone.</p>
</Accordion>
